# Hazard pointers
Implement Hazard Pointers.

1. Read [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1291819).
   While this paper is sufficient for understanding Hazard Pointers,
   you may also want to take a look at [WG21 P1121](http://wg21.link/P1121),
   the proposal for adding Hazard Pointers to the C++ standard library.
2. Read the documentation in [`hazard_pointer/mod.rs`](../src/hazard_pointer/mod.rs)
3. Fill in the `todo!()`s in
   [`hazard_pointer/hazard.rs`](../src/hazard_pointer/hazard.rs) and
   [`hazard_pointer/retire.rs`](../src/hazard_pointer/retire.rs)
   (approx 75 lines).
